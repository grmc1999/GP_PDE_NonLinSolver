Code for the paper [Solving and Learning Nonlinear PDEs with Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12959) Solvers with the flavor of automation in scientific machine learning: a general framework for PDEs and inverse problems in science.


Packages required: [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)
- [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is used for automatic differentiation and vectorization of the constriction of Gram matrices, and the Gauss-Newton iteration. It can be avoid if the users supplement the derivatives manually.
